**THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE! USE WITH CAUTION**

tigerlib is a library meant at reducing the year to year recreation of nearly identical code for the Iron Tigers Robotics Team.

## Installation with Gradle

1. Add the jitpack maven repository to the end of the repositories block in your `build.gradle` file:

    ```Gradle
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
    ```
2. Add the library to the end of the depencies block in your `build.gradle` file:
   
   ```Gradle
    dependencies {
        ...
	    implementation 'com.github.itrt4176:tigerlib:v2023.1.0-beta1'
	}
   ```
